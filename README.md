# Steve-The-Gecko-Discord-Bot
*Note the way the bot is set up, pretty much only I can use it, but if you want STG on your server get in touch with me*

Steve The Gecko (STG) is a discord bot that was created for fun. The main feature of the bot is to have a virtual dog that you turn into.
You can then have jobs, buy houses etc. Join the discord to play: https://discord.gg/A6GZWuX

Yes I know it is not all "properly" coded such as all the global variables, but I was lazy so...

Features:
- Moderating features like clearing messages (no mute/ban yet)
- Echo command to have a bot say a message in any channel
- Dming
- Conversation responses that can have cooldown timers
- Sending received dm's to a channel
- Gecko Game - number guessing game that has rewards for getting to a certain number
- Survival Game - text based game where you make decisions when you run into people/animals. Save your ammo, gather food and survive longer for a higher score.
- Doggo Game - just join the discord to play this one :)
